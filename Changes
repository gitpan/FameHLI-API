Revision history for Perl extension FameHLI.

2.101 Sun Mar 20, 2005
    FameHLI::API
    Cfmwstr had an artificial limit of 255 characters on any string
    written.  This should be working correctly now.  Thanks to 
    Tarik Adi for pointing this out.

2.100 Tue Mar 15, 2005
    FameHLI (Makefile.PL)
	Since the Linux LessTif now uses x.org (Fedora 3 and RHEL4) there
    is now a test to see if $FAME/fame will run.  If not, it could be
    because libXm.so.1 can't be found.  We can still run everything
    except Cfmfame and MCADBS so a test checks this and allows skipping
    the tests that would fail otherwise.

    FameHLI::API
    Finally got around to making the Missing Value functions return
    a "valid" return code to let you know that they don't really
    work. Jeff Kaplan suggested using "Doesn't work in current context".
    - Cfmsnm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmspm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmsbm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmsdm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmisnm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmispm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmisbm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmisdm returns HBCNTX
    - Cfmissm returns HBCNTX

2.001 Tue feb 8, 2005
    FameHLI::API
    Thanks to Ken Kingsbury for finding a buglet in Cfmwhat().  The
    documentation string was being cut off to the length of the 
    description string.
    - Modified Cfmwhat to use the proper length variable.

    FameHLI::API
    Thanks again to Daniel Martin for changes to the Makefile and
    some of the .xs files to work on Linux (with libchli.a).  Also,
    he caught a buglet in Cfmgtstr().
    - Modified several functions to use New() and Safefree()
      instead of safemalloc() and safefree().

1.200 Mon Aug 5, 2002 (never made it public... oops.)
    FameHLI::API
    Thanks to Patrick Chamberlain for bug reports:
    - Modified Cfmwstr to use references to missing value strings
      in the 'proper' way.

    FameHLI::API/tests
    Thanks to Jeremy Yoder for fixes and suggestions:
    - Modified test suite to use 'USERNAME' and 'PASSWORD' properly
      for those of you who use authenticated MCADBS servers.
    - Modified test suite to check for $FAME variable being defined.
      Since some of us put the license files in $FAME_PATH, I can't
      check for license files, but there is only so much you CAN
      do, isn't there?

1.101 Fri May 3, 2002

    FameHLI::API
    - Modified Cfmrrng to return "proper" missing values instead
      of the Fame internal representation.  For instance, a missing
      NUMERIC would be around 1.7E+38.  It now returns a reference
      to a string "NA", "NC" or "ND".
    FameHLI::API/tests
    - Added 6 tests to 12_Writing and 13_Reading to ensure the
      aforementioned missing values are being handled properly for
      NUMERIC.  2 each (writing and reading) for each of the three
      missing data types.  I did not put in tests for the other 
      data types but may, someday...

1.100 Tue Feb 12, 2002

    Most of the changes in this release came from Daniel Martin of
    Fame Information Services.  He answered the question "If anyone
    can figure out how to get this to work in Windows..."

    He did.

    FameHLI::all
    - Removed the reference to <strings.h>.
    - Changed the Exporter variables to use "use vars qw()" instead
      of "our" so that older versions of Perl can compile the module.
    - Modified the Makefile.PL in a number of ways so that 'nmake'
      will work on Windows.
    - Modified the Makefile.PL to more intelligently check paths
      for hli.h and library files on either Unix or Windows.
    FameHLI::API
    - cfmini() is now called in bootstrapping the module and Cfmini()
      allows you to call it multiple times.  It will simply return
      the HSUCC if it ever succeeded or the most recent status.  This
      allows you to check (in your program) if $FAME is set and
      recover if it isn't.
    FameHLI::API/tests
    - Removed the test for Cfmver() failing prior to calling
      Cfmini() since that is called automagically occuring boot.

1.000 Mon Sep 10, 2001

    FameHLI::API
    - Some of the noted fixes here may have happened in an earlier
      release but were not mentioned below so I mention them here.

    - Fixed a 'hard to get' SEGV problem in Cfmnxwc by converting
      from using the NO_INIT option for argument variables and
      making anything that gets returned into an SV*.
    - May have prevented lots of other SEGV problems because I just
      went ahead and did the same for all functions.
    - Fixed an odd bug in Cfm xxxx (rlen) where it would behave
      oddly if you gave it a predefined array of data. (2358/2339)

    - Changed handling of FREQ such that anything that isn't one of
      the 6 non-date frequencies is 'defaulted' to a DATE freq.
      After all, what else is there?  (And error handling will find
      out if it is an invalid freq anyway.)
    - Changed the default handling of Missing Values so that
      any occurrance of a missing value is turned into a reference
      to a string "NA", "NC" or "ND".

    - Removed Cfmglen() function.  It is unnecessary.
    - Removed Cfmdlen() function.  It is unnecessary.
    - Defaulted Cfmgtatt() function length arguments inlen and
      outlen.  They are unnecessary.
    - Removed Cfmlatt() function.  It is unnecessary.
    - Defaulted Cfmgtali() function length arguments inlen and
      outlen.  They are unnecessary.
    - Removed Cfmlali() function.  It is unnecessary.
    - Removed Cfmnlen() function.  It is unnecessary.
    - Defaulted Cfmgtnl() function length arguments inlen and
      outlen.  They are unnecessary.
    - Defaulted Cfmgtsts() function length arguments inlen and
      outlen.  They are unnecessary.

    FameHLI::API/tests
    - Commented the PWD.sample file
    - Changed the defaults in t/subs.pm to "none".
    - Changed all test files which access values in the PWD file
      so that they will "Skip" functions which need those values
      if they are set to "none".

0.903 Mon Apr 23, 2001

    FameHLI::API
    - Fixed the "Date Frequency" stuff.  If a data type is not one
      of the standard "Num, Prec, Str or Bool" datatypes then it
      is probably one of the several hundred Date Frequencies.
    - Made the length arguments optional (and ignored) of functions 
      which return strings.  This brings FameHLI in line with
      TimeIQ in relieving the programmer from that drudge.
    - Added the new "cfmspos" function for 9.0.  Please see Fame
      docs when 9.0 comes out.  This function has a pretty strong
      'gotcha' if your program exits abnormally.
    - Removed "Get Length" functions and inserted "defaults" for 
      length arguments.
    - Removed 'cfmopre' function.

    FameHLI::API/tests
    - Removed arguments from functions not needing "length" related
      elements.
    - Removed tests for depricated functions.
    - Removed "Get Length" function tests
    - Removed Cfmopre which is depricated.  Change calls to use
      'cfmopcn' and 'cfmoprc' instead.

0.902 Thu Apr 19, 2001

    FameHLI::API
    - Removed a quirky internal function which wasn't really needed
    - Added in several of the "how long is that" string function for
      completeness.  They aren't really needed because if the caller
      of the string retrieval function doesn't specify a length (or
      gives a length of '0'), I just figure it out for them.
    - Found 2 possible bugs in the C-HLI: cfmfame prints out an error
      message to STDERR or STDOUT upon an error condition and 
      cfmlerr returns an error length of '0' for that same condition.
    - Converted several more functions from standard 'C' data type
      arguments to SV*'s.  It seems to confuse the compiler less.
    - Added the ':all' EXPORT_TAG so everything could be imported.
    - Added the comments to API.pm supporting the added tests
      noted below.

    FameHLI::API/tests
    - Added tests for other functions which are defined but were not
      tested in the previous release.
    - Changed all but test 08 to import all functions and #defines
      so I could clear out some noisey text in those files.  It
      makes it easier for a C-HLI programmer to see what is going
      on.  08 has been left with fully qualified names for 
      instructional purposes.

    FameHLI::API::EXT
    - It appears that the EXT module runs in a different space from
      the API module.  I would get Not Initialized errors from CFM
      calls in the EXT module if I didn't call cfmini there as well
      in the BOOT code.
    - Added the ':all' EXPORT_TAG so everything could be imported.
