    FameHLI::API
    - Removed a quirky internal function which wasn't really needed
    - Added in several of the "how long is that" string function for
      completeness.  They aren't really needed because if the caller
      of the string retrieval function doesn't specify a length (or
      gives a length of '0'), I just figure it out for them.
    - Found 2 possible bugs in the C-HLI: cfmfame prints out an error
      message to STDERR or STDOUT upon an error condition and 
      cfmlerr returns an error length of '0' for that same condition.
    - Converted several more functions from standard 'C' data type
      arguments to SV*'s.  It seems to confuse the compiler less.
    - Added the ':all' EXPORT_TAG so everything could be imported.
    - Added the comments to API.pm supporting the added tests
      noted below.

    FameHLI::API/tests
    - Added tests for other functions which are defined but were not
      tested in the previous release.
    - Changed all but test 08 to import all functions and #defines
      so I could clear out some noisey text in those files.  It
      makes it easier for a C-HLI programmer to see what is going
      on.  08 has been left with fully qualified names for 
      instructional purposes.

    FameHLI::API::EXT
    - It appears that the EXT module runs in a different space from
      the API module.  I would get Not Initialized errors from CFM
      calls in the EXT module if I didn't call cfmini there as well
      in the BOOT code.
    - Added the ':all' EXPORT_TAG so everything could be imported.
